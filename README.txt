PURPOSE

An Auto-DJ for MediaMonkey that randomly plays the songs in the currently
visible song list avoiding to play duplicates. Thus it is easy to start
playing with Auto-DJ and than changing the mood, occasion, genre or alike
and have Auto-DJ pick new random songs from the current setting without
picking songs twice. Duplicates are prevented by examining the now playing
list. If all selectable songs have already been played the currently visible
song list is played randomly once again.



TARGET AUDIENCE

MediaMonkey users that like to have an Auto-DJ that adapts to their
behavior of changing filters like occasion/mood/genre.
